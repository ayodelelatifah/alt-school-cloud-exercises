Assignment 5: Git Configuration and Project Cloning

In this assignment, I cloned the project `alt-school-cloud-exercise` to my local system and configured Git with my name and email using the global settings. I also captured and submitted the outputs of `git config -l`, `git remote -v`, and `git log` to demonstrate proper version control setup and repository tracking.
