Assignment: Checking Running Processes

In this assignment, I used terminal commands like `ps aux` and `top` to view running processes on my system. I listed five active processes, described their roles, and provided my opinion on their importance for system functionality. This demonstrates understanding of process management and system monitoring in Linux.
