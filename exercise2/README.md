# Assignment 2: Linux Commands with Explanations

In this assignment, I have compiled and explained 10 fundamental `Linux commands`, providing clear usage examples and annotated screenshots to illustrate their functionality. Each command is accompanied by a visual demonstration, embedded within this Markdown file, to enhance understanding and practical application.

I have 2 other files attached, one has 5 other commands and the other has a `PDF Version` of the 10 Linux Commands in the markdown file in the exercise2 folder.
